## Assignment 4: Styling A Table Instructions

In this assignment you will take my HTML code and create a single html file called hw1.css.  It should style the page following the guidelines provided.  You can see an example final product at [http://www.intro-webdesign.com/CSS/final/teams.jpg]

### Review criteria

You will review each submission based on whether each objective/style is achieved or not, and at what level.  (For instance, did they put in background-color and if so, did they use hexadecimal or rgb.)

Specifically, you will evaluate submissions by answering the following questions: 

* Is the table element styled?

* Are the table headings properly styled?

* Are ONLY the corners of the table styled?

* Does the opacity of a table row change when it is hovered over?

* Are the table elements styled?

### Instructions

Steps:

1) The table should be styled using at least four properties 

2) The table headings should have a border, background color, and at least one other property.

3) Style the table so that the text in the first column is left-aligned and the text in the other two columns is centered 

4) Set the opacity of the table rows to a value between .6 and .8 (make sure it is still visible) 

5) Change the opacity of a row when it is hovered over 

6) The table elements < td > should be styled using at least four properties

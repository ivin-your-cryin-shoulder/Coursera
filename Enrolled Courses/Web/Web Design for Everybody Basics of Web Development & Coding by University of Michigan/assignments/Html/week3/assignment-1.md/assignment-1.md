### Examples of Good Feedback

As a reviewer, you will be required to provide feedback on other people's assignment.

When providing feedback, it is a good practice to first indicate what the learner did well on the assignment. After that, help the learner improve by providing specific, actionable advice.  Don't feel badly about pointing out mistakes - we are all here to learn.

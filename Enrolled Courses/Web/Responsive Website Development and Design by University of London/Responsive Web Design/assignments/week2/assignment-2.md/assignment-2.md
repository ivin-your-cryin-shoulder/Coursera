## Assignment 2: Working with navbars Instructions

In this exercise, you will learn how to work with navbar code by customising a navbar we have created for you. 

You will download some starter code, then you will edit the code, changing the navbar according to the instructions. 

You then have to upload screenshots of your navbar in a normal and collapsed form. Your peers will visually inspect the navbars to ensure you have made the requested changes. 

It should not take more than 15-30 minutes to complete. 

### Review criteria

You will be graded based on whether or not you have made the requested changes to the navbar. Your peers will visually inspect screenshots of the navbar that you provide. 

### Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

### Step 1:

Download the starter code to your computer.

### Step 2:

Unzip the file you just downloaded.
    


### Step 3
Open the index.html file in your text editor and your browser, then make and test the following changes:

* Edit the text 'Project name' that is at the left of the navbar  so it is is your name 

* Edit the text 'Item 1' and 'Item 2' to be 'CV' and 'Portfolio'. 

* Edit the text 'Dropdown' to be 'Contact'. 

* Edit the items in drop down menu so it contains 'Email' and 'Skype'.

### Step 4:

Prepare two screenshots for submission:
	
1. The navbar as it would appear on a desktop computer screen - it should be in non-collapsed, horizontal form (see the example). Make sure the dropdown menu it in its expanded form. 
2. The navbar as it would appear on a narrow mobile screen. It should be in its vertical form (see the example). Make sure the dropdown menu is in its expanded form.
